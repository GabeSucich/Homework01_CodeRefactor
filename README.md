# Homework 01: Code Refactor

An HTML file and a CSS file were provided, which together yielded a website. Although the website rendered successfully, the HTML code was missing semantic keys, not properly formatted, and not thematically or aesthetically organized. Additionally, the CSS file was unorganized, had no comment tags explaining the styling, and was full of styling redundancies to be reduced. The goal of this project was to refactor the code so that it met a set of acceptance criteria relating to website accessibility standards. In the spirit of "leaving code cleaner than you found it", I was to revise the code so that, leaving the website unchanged (with the exception of fixing a bug), the issues outlined above were resolved. After finishing, the HTML and CSS files were clearer, more concise, and more well organized for others to read.
